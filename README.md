# Identify-NcRNA-Sub-Loc-MKGHkNN

This repository contains code for our paper "Identify subcellular localization for non-coding RNA based on multi-kernel graph regularized k-local hyperplane distance nearest neighbor model".

Folders:
1. code: MATLAB codes for our model;
2. datasets: RNA sequences data and extracted feature vectors.

We also provide online service via http://ncrna.lbci.net/.
