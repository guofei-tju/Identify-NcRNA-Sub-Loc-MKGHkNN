model

This fold contains codes of our model and other base model in our paper.

1. ghknn: codes for ghknn and multi-kernel ghknn.
2. hknn: codes for hknn and multi-label hknn;
3. knn: codes for multi-label knn;
4. svm: codes for multi-label svm;
5. hsic_kernel_weights_norm.m: function to calculate weights of HSIC multi-kernel learning;
6. line_map.m: function to scale feature into (0, 1);
7. multilabel_ghknn.m: multi-label version of ghknn, using one-vs-rest strategy;
8. multilabel_ghknn_mkl.m: multilabel_ghknn with multi-kernel learning, which is the model we used in our study.
